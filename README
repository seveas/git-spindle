Github integration for git
==========================

With this git subcommand, you can perform various github actions, such as
creating or forking a repository from the command line.

Install instructions:

You need to install docopt, requests, whelk and github3.py first. docopt,
requests and whelk can be installed with pip, github3.py (as of writing) needs
to be cloned from github as the released versions are not quite there yet.

With those prerequisites met, place git-hub somewhere on your $PATH or in git's
libexec dir, and you're done.

pip install http://seveas.net/git-hub
